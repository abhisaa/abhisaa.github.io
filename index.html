  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <p>I tried to put some logic to check the availability of the vaccine in a particular district with the help of JavaScript and Postman. For this I did try to get the response from api used in "https://www.cowin.gov.in/home" portal. I filtered the data on the basies of the age (18 to 45) and availability. Then I printed the relevant data which I needed in the console. This data I printed in every 1 second with the help of timer.</p>
  <h2>Prerequisite:</h2>
  <li>
	<ul>Little knowledge of JavaScript.</ul>
	<ul>Undersanding of Postman tool.</ul>
	<ul>Understanding of Google Chrome or Firefox Debugger.</ul>
  </li>
