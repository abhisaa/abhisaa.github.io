<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>I tried to put some logic to check the availability of the vaccine in a particular district with the help of
    JavaScript and Postman. For this I did try to get the response from api used in "https://www.cowin.gov.in/home"
    portal. I filtered the data on the basies of the age (18 to 45) and availability. Then I printed the relevant data
    which I needed in the console. This data I printed in every 1 second with the help of timer.</p>

    <ol>Little knowledge of JavaScript.</ol>
    <ol>Undersanding of Postman tool.</ol>
