<h1 class="headingVaccine">Track Vaccine Availability</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hope all of you and your family members are keeping well. During these times, when we all are battling with this
    pandemic in our own ways. Getting the vaccine has become a priority for us. The major issue that we are facing here
    is booking the slot for the vaccines. Here is my small contribution in resolving this issue. I created a script
    using JavaScript to able to fetch the slots in a faster and better manner. I have listed all the steps that have to
    followed below "abhisaa.github.io". Please make use of this and book your slots for vaccine. Would love to hear your
    comments and feedback on this.</p>
<h2>Prerequisite:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Little knowledge of JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Installation and little understanding of Postman tool.</li>
    <li>Understanding of Google Chrome or Firefox Debugger.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open this portal on your laptop <b>"https://www.cowin.gov.in/home"</b> in your Google Chrome (I used this, you
        can use
        Firefox as well).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Open the Chrome Debugger tools by pressing <b>F12</b> key on your keyboard or you can do this on the portal
        anywhere by:
        <b>Right click -> Inspect</b>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="first.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Go to the <b>"Network"</b> tab and clear the previous network calls.</li>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="clearConsole.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Go to the CoWIN Portal again and either click on <b>"Search by Pin"</b> or <b>"Search by District"</b>. In
        this following image,I have selected the <b>"Search by District"</b> option. Then Select your preferred State
        and District and hit <b>"Search"</b> button.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="search.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Now go to the Chrome Debugger and check that an API calling entry should be there in the left side pane. Click
        on
        that, copy the url and keep this URL in a text file to use in one of the upcoming steps.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="copyURL.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Now open the Postman and click on <b>"NEW"</b>. Then select <b>"Request"</b></li>
    .
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="selectRequest.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Now provide the <b>"Name"</b>. Select or create the Collection/Folder and save it</li>
    .
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="saveRequest.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Paste the URL inside the URL input box and make sure the left side dropDown should be set to <b>"GET"</b>.
        Automatically <b>"district_id"</b> and <b>"date"</b> PARAMETERS will get populated under the <b>"Params"</b>
        tab.
    </li>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="params.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Go to <b>"Test"</b> tab and paste the code snippet (given below) inside the text box.
        After that Click on <b>"Console"</b> present at the left side bottom corner.
    </li>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-javascript">
        let respData = []

        setInterval(function(){
        _.each(pm.response.json().centers, (item) => {
            _.each(item.sessions, (subItem) => {
                if(subItem.min_age_limit < 45 && subItem.available_capacity > 0) {
                respData.push({
                   Name: item.name,
                    BlockName: item.block_name,
                    Capacity: subItem.available_capacity,
                  })
                }
            })
         });
        console.log(respData);
        }, 1000);

      </code>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <img class="debug_image" src="code.jpg"/>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Clear the console with <b>"Clear"</b> button present at the right side for the console pane.
        And then hit the <b>"Send"</b> button. There you'll see the details coming in the form of Array if vaccine is
        available for the age 18 to 45.
    </li>
    <br>

</ol>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
    With this, you can hit the api after desired time(inside the code 1000 represents 1 second) and monitor the response
    (if you are getting any). I just tried to automate the clicking of search button on Co-WIN portal and looking out
    for the data manually. I executed this script and fortunately within 5 minutes the slots were open and after which I
    was able to get the details in console. This is how it helped me in booking the slot just under 5 minutes.
