<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>I tried to put some logic to check the availability of the vaccine in a particular district with the help of
    JavaScript and Postman. For this I did try to get the response from api used in "https://www.cowin.gov.in/home"
    portal. I filtered the data on the basies of the age (18 to 45) and availability. Then I printed the relevant data
    which I needed in the console. This data I printed in every 1 second with the help of timer.</p>
<h2>Prerequisite:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Little knowledge of JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Undersanding of Postman tool.</li>
    <li>Understanding of Google Chrome or Firefox Debugger.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open this portal on your laptop <b>"https://www.cowin.gov.in/home"</b> in your Google Chrome (I used this, you can use
        Firefox as well).
    </li>
    <li>Open the Chrome Debugger tools by pressing <b>F12</b> key on your keyboard or you can do this on the portal anywhere by:
        <b>Right click -> Inspect</b>.
    </li>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Go to the Cowin Portal again and either click on <b>"Search by Pin"</b> or <b>"Search by District"</b>. In
        this following image,I have selected the <b>"Search by District"</b> option. Then Select your preferred State
        and District and hit <b>"Search"</b> button.

    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Now go to the Crome Debugger and check that an API calling entry should be there in the left side pane. Click on
        that, copy the url and keep this URL in a text file to use in one of the upcoming steps.
